# Running the game
`gawk -f awkaster.awk`

You need `gawk` version >= `4.0.0`


OS X users must install `gawk` first. The easiest way to do this is to use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Once it has been installed, run the following commands:
```
brew update
brew install gawk
```

NetBSD users require `gawk`. The easiest way to do it is install it with [pkgin](http://pkgin.net):
```
pkgin install gawk
```

Alternatively install from sources using the [pkgsrc framework](https://pkgsrc.org/):
```
cd /usr/pkgsrc/lang/gawk && make install
```


OpenBSD users require `gawk`. The easiest way to do it is install it with [pkg_add](http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man1/pkg_add.1):
```
pkg_add gawk
```

Alternatively install from sources using the [OpenBSD ports](http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man1/ports.7):
```
cd /usr/ports/lang/gawk && make install clean
```
Your machine will now be ready to run *awkaster*.

# How to play
Your objective is to navigate the map and activate exit elevator, killing hordes of monsters in the process.

Controls:
* WASD - movement
* J/L - turn left/right. Hold shift to turn quicker
* spacebar - shoot
* num 1-4 - change color mode
* x - activate elevator (arrives after 1000 moves)

# Adjusting resolution
By default game resolution is 64x48 "pixels", which are just a pair of ASCII symbols. That means your terminal needs to be at least 128 chars wide. You may change variables `w` and `h` to your liking.

# Game engine
Wall rendering is done using ray casting. Monsters and projectiles are added after that as sprites.
Ray casting is a simple rendering algorithm that doesn't require any 3d modeling or complex computation.
